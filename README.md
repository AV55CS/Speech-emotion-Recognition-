## 🔬 Research Overview

Our work focuses on two main contributions:

### 1. **LAQ+MLP: Efficient SER for Edge Devices**
- Layer-wise Adaptive Quantization with Multi-Layer Perceptron
- Achieved 99.29% accuracy on TESS dataset with only 169K parameters
- Model compression to 25KB while maintaining performance

### 2. **Multi-Branch Ensemble Architecture**
- Comprehensive 15-experiment ablation study
- Four processing branches: Temporal, Prototype-based, Global, and Refinement
- Cross-dataset validation on EMODB, RAVDESS, SAVEE, and TESS

### 3. **TIM-Net Implementation**
- Advanced temporal modeling for emotion recognition
- 10-fold cross-validation across multiple datasets
- State-of-the-art performance on challenging benchmarks

## 📊 Key Results Preview

| Method | TESS | EMODB | SAVEE | RAVDESS |
|--------|------|-------|-------|---------|
| LAQ+MLP | **99.29%** | 75.93% | 81.25% | - |
